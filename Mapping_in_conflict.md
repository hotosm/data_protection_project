# Mapping in Conflict old doc

## Overview 
HOT, and the larger Humanitarian Mapping community, often face dilemmas related to risk of harm to communities and beneficiaries. This is particularly acute, though not limited to, situations of conflict. This project is a selection of resources for HOT, associated communities, and the larger humanitarian mapping and data community to approach mapping in situations of conflict, humanitarian settings, and other sensitive contexts.

## Scope
Impact not opsec
This project does not directly address operational safety and security for activities in conflict or other hazardous zones, which is critically important but is a separate topic (and one that usually requires a pragmatic, management-intensive approach rather than a policy-driven approach). 

This project's focus is on the potential impact (both positive and negative) and risks to communities being mapped. It's primarily about the mapped, not the mappers.

Humanitarian contexts including conflict
For the purposes of this project, we will distinguish between humanitarian and development or natural disaster response contexts. 

Development contexts are broadly those in which the local government is a partner or stakeholder assumed to be acting generally in the interests of the population. This includes natural disaster settings, provided that they do not involve an ongoing context of deliberate harm and/or exclusion. In development and natural disaster contexts, the Sustainable Development Goals constitute the standard guiding principles (additionally, in the case of agencies working with digital tools, the Digital Development Principles are often added to the SDGs as standard guidance).

The moment there is a substantial component of deliberate harm affecting the communities involved, it becomes a humanitarian context, and the four humanitarian principles (Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, and Independence) constitute the governing principles for action. The most obvious example of a humanitarian context is war; both humanitarian law and humanitarian principles originated to address the suffering created in armed conflict.
Vision
A coherent set of policies, guidelines, tools, resources, and communications that reflect humanitarian principles, HOT values, informed consent, and genuine inclusion/consultation with HOT voting membership, communities, staff, board, and affected communities.
Specific Elements
Policy paper: outlines the principles and policies that guide HOT's decisions about mapping in conflict and humanitarian settings
Toolkit to identify the kinds of contexts where the , and some guidance and resources to make decisions
Communications
Blogs (public-facing)
Discussions (more internal—intended for HOT and associated communities to share and learn)

# Other actors work/maps
A place for a quick & dirty list of other actor’s maps, projects, and statements related to the Ukraine conflict primarily (other conflict maps can be linked here if interesting and relevant). If it gets too big and unwieldy, to be placed in a separate doc.
