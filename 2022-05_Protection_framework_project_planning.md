| Jessie       | Support on overall data policy structure and strategy, policy draft review.                                          |

|              |                                                                                                                      |

## Scope
What is in and out of scope?
*In scope* - policies that directly guide decision making on data collection activity (what to collect when and where) based on context, humanitarian principles, HOT’s values, and responsible activity.
*Out of scope* - logistical safety on the ground for field data collection. 
## Approach
Define milestones

1. version 1 that covers our intended audiences. Materials in Google Docs.
2. external review
3. open community process - engage with external interested stakeholders, such as Heather Leason (IFRC), Steve Penson (ACAPS), Gemma Davies (MapAction), others that have expressed interest. Nate Raymond? Amos Doornbos?

## Structure and prioritization

| Name                         | Purpose                                                                                        | Priority | Key questions                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Principles              | Incorporate HOT’s values, mission into guidelines for making responsible data decisions.       |          |                                                                                                        |
| Data Protection Policy       | Ensure the information for data collected in association to HOT does no harm.                  |          | Naming - is there something that communicates the purpose better (for our audience) than “protection”? |
| Mapping in Conflict Policy   | Extra steps to the Data Protection Policy in the sensitive context of conflict.                |          |                                                                                                        |
| Spatial Data Security Policy | Ensure that data collected via direct observation or remotely is managed and handled securely. |          |                                                                                                        |
| Data Impact Assessment       |                                                                                                |          |                                                                                                        |
| Data Collection Design       |                                                                                                |          | Connects closely to Impact areas & Tech (which mobile data collection tools to support)                |
