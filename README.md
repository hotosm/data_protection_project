# HOTOSM Ethical Data and Protection Project

This is the public portal for HOT's policies, guidance, tools, and resources for Ethical Data and Protection in open humanitarian mapping.

The resources here are used internally by HOT Open Mapping Hubs, the HOT Central team, and associated communities. However, in keeping with HOT's commitment to open data, public resources, collaboration, and above all community-first action, we are pleased to make this repository available to anyone&mdash;not only to read, but to contribute with content, suggestions, critiques, and resources.

# How to Use these Tools

First and foremost, this toolkit represents a process to think through Protection risk when starting new open mapping activities. At it's heart is a [spreadsheet-based tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sa3umVxfSBsqWxVpP8HjYOS0rwYsuHgPDfMIhSMtlnM/edit?usp=sharing) which begin at the stage of a new project proposal and guide users through a rapid process to determine the baseline level of Protection risk and decide what Risk Assessment procedure to use.

For field mapping projects launched, managed, or directly supported by HOT, the project lead should complete the spreadsheet above *before beginning project activities*.

Each blue node in the flowchart is a *decision-making node*, and links to a tab in the spreadsheet. For example, the Context Categorization node corresponds to a Context Categorization tab in the spreadsheet, which provides a set of criteria and examples to guide the user in a decision about the inherent protection risk level of the context they are considering working in.

## What is in the Toolkit

* [HOT Protection Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llx29NnSyTm8WUG9Q4FFPRVp8vPgpOaRJgTCg7e9ulQ/edit#heading=h.qatrmq7kxvx9)
* [Spreadsheet-Based Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sa3umVxfSBsqWxVpP8HjYOS0rwYsuHgPDfMIhSMtlnM/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Training Workshop Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XzexnMiMyWKldJcoZysC1AvU9YVTHGozRgbhOsfO2G8/edit?usp=sharing). It is most effective when used by an experienced trainer, but for people somewhat familiar with Protection concepts and risk assessment it may serve as a reasonable self-study resource.

### Download the Zip file and Get Started
The easiest way to access all resource documents is to click the green ```Code``` button near the top right of the screen, press ```Download ZIP```, and extract it onto your hard drive.

[You can also download the Zip file of everything on this Github directly here](https://github.com/hotosm/data_protection_project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
You then have your very own local copy of everything that you can use, modify, personalize, and enjoy without messing it up for anyone else! You don't need a GitHub account or any tech skills other than the ability to extract a zip file [(like this)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5#:~:text=Do%20one%20of%20the%20following,and%20then%20follow%20the%20instructions.).

### Clone the Git Repo

For those of you that enjoy using Git (or would like to learn) this is really a nice way of making things available for people to contribute freely while retaining a consistent set of tools for end users.

If you are experienced with Git and Github, and particularly if you would like to contribute to this resource, it is better to clone or fork the repo (we assume if you are experienced with Git and Github you know how this works). This has two major advantages:
1. You can always get the most updated version of the tools by using ```git pull```
2. You can contribute your own suggested changes via a pull request, making the toolkit better for everyone!
