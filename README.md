# HOTOSM Data Protection Project

Policies, guidance, tools, and resources for Data Protection in humanitarian mapping

# Vision

A coherent set of policies, guidelines, tools, resources, and communications on data protection that reflect humanitarian principles, relevant development principles, HOT values, informed consent, and genuine inclusion/consultation with HOT voting membership, communities, staff, board, global stakeholders, and affected communities.

# Scope
In scope - policies that directly guide decision making on data collection activity (what to collect when and where) based on context, humanitarian principles, HOT’s values, and responsible activity.

Out of scope - logistical safety on the ground for field data collection.
